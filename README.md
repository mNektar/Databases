This project was part of the Databases course in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of the Aristotle University in Thessaloniki and was implemented by me and 2 more fellow students. 
Instructions given by the professor are included in each folder. 
The 'Deliverable 1' folder contains the first design of the project on paper. 
The 'Deliverable 2' folder contains the database, as it was designed in the first deliverable, implemented in MySQL.

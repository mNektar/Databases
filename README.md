This project was part of the Databases course in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of the Aristotle University in Thessaloniki and was implemented by me and 2 more fellow students. 
Instructions given by the professor are included in each folder. The '1. Initial Presentation' folder contains the initial idea of the project as well as the presentation as presented by our team.
The '1. Deliverable 1' folder contains the first design of the project on paper. The '2. Deliverable 2' folder contains the database, as it was designed in the first deliverable, implemented in MySQL.
The '3. Deliverable 3' folder contains the optional part of the project - the implementation of an application for the database we created. 
Finally, the '4. Final Presentation' folder contains the final presentation of our project as it was presented by our team. 

Note: Due to the limited amount of time given for 'Deliverable 3' and the subject of it not being a part of the course material, the application is somewhat unfinished - it does some basic functions.
